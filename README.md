# OSS Projects

Many projects have README fles like this. They ehlp to describe what the project does.

In general, they just provide info that's helpfl to anyone new to the project.

Usually, they'll start off with a brief descripton of what the project is, and how to use it.

They might also include some documentation on how to use speific features of the project.

Finally, they'll have a section on how to build the project from source, and how to contribute.

For some more info on exactly how they're structured, ake a look at the rEADMEs for some popular projects.

## Instructions

Don't modify this part. There aren't any typos (hopefully).

Click the fork button above, which will bring you to your own version of this project. Importantly, you can modify that version.

Copy and paste its URL, then open up a terminal (such as Git Bash) in a directory like Desktop or Documents. Next, run `git clone FORK_URL`.

After this, you should have a directory called `Git-OSS-Project`. Inside of it is this file.

Your contribution will be looking at the above section, finding a few typos, and fixing them. Make sure to select typos from throughout the
whole section. That way, everyone will have a chance of fixing their own typo.

Once you've modified the file on your computer, you need to upload it to your GitHub fork. Type `git add *` in your terminal (make sure you're in the `Git-OSS-Project` folder).
If you'd like to, you can also type `git status` to look at what files have changed. Next, run `git commit -m "Fixed typos"`. This creates a "commit" (a little package containing your changes + some metadata about them)
with the name `Fixed typos`. Now that we have a commit, we can upload it to GitHub with `git push -u origin main`.

Now, the changes are in your own fork, but not in the main repository. In order to bring them over, go to the GitHub page for your fork, refresh the page, and click the button prompting you to
create a pull request. Now, you can give it a name and description, and then submit it. Someone with write access to the repository (in this case, me) will review it, and if it looks good (which it probably will),
it'll get merged.

After that, the typos will be no more!
